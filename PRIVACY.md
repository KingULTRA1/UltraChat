# UltraChat Privacy Policy

*Effective Date: August 30, 2025*  
*Version: 1.2.3 Alpha*

## Our Privacy-First Commitment

UltraChat is built from the ground up with privacy as our core principle. We believe your conversations belong to you, not to us or any third party.

## What We Collect

**The short answer: Nothing.**

UltraChat operates on a **zero-data collection** model:

- ✅ **No account registration** required
- ✅ **No personal information** collected
- ✅ **No message content** stored on our servers
- ✅ **No metadata** tracking or analytics
- ✅ **No cookies** or tracking pixels
- ✅ **Local storage only** - everything stays on your device

## How UltraChat Works

### End-to-End Encryption
- All messages are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** encryption
- Key exchange uses **RSA-2048** cryptography
- Only you and your conversation partner can read your messages
- We cannot decrypt your messages even if we wanted to

### Local Data Storage
- All your data is stored locally on your device
- Profile information, contacts, and message history never leave your device
- No cloud synchronization by default (optional for enterprise users)

### Web of Trust
- Trust ratings are calculated locally
- No central authority or server validation
- Community-driven trust system without data collection

## Legal Compliance

UltraChat is designed to comply with major privacy regulations:
- **GDPR**: No data collection means no privacy concerns

Since we don't collect personal data, most privacy regulations don't apply to our core service.

## Free and Open Source

UltraChat will always remain:
- ✅ **Free** for personal use

- ✅ **Privacy-first** by design
- ✅ **Community-driven** development
- ✅ **No ads** or tracking ever

Enterprise features help fund development while keeping the core product free and private for everyone.

**Remember**: If a service is free and you're not paying, you're usually the product. With UltraChat, you're never the product because we don't want your data.
