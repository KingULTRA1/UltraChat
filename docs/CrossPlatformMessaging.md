# UltraChat Cross-Platform Messaging Architecture

## 1. Overview

UltraChat provides a unified messaging experience across multiple platforms through a centralized bridge service that maintains a single identity while interacting with external services.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1 Unified Interface Layer

```
UltraChat Application
├── Message Router
├── Platform Adapters
├── Identity Manager
└── Feature Controller
```

### 2.2 Platform Adapters

Each supported platform has a dedicated adapter that handles:
- Authentication with the external service
- Message translation between UltraChat and platform formats
- Event handling for platform-specific features
- Status synchronization

## 3. Message Flow

## 4. Platform Integration Details

### 4.1 Discord Integration

- Uses Discord.js library
- Supports text channels, voice channels, and direct messages
- Implements role-based access control
- Handles rich embeds and file attachments

### 4.2 Telegram Integration

- Uses node-telegram-bot-api library
- Supports private chats, group chats, and channels
- Implements inline keyboards and bot commands
- Handles media and document sharing

### 4.3 Signal Integration

- Uses signal-cli for communication
- Supports end-to-end encrypted messaging
- Handles group management
- Implements message expiration settings

### 4.4 Twitter/X Integration

- Uses twitter-api-v2 library
- Supports direct messages and mentions
- Implements tweet scheduling
- Handles media uploads

### 4.5 SMS Integration

- Uses platform-specific SMS APIs
- Supports two-way messaging
- Implements message queuing
- Handles delivery receipts

## 5. Identity Management

### 5.1 Single Identity Principle

UltraChat maintains a single user identity across all platforms:
- One keypair per device
- Account type determines feature access
- Consistent display name and avatar
- Unified trust rating system

### 5.2 Platform-Specific Handles

Users can configure platform-specific handles while maintaining their UltraChat identity:
- Discord username
- Telegram handle
- Signal phone number
- Twitter/X username
- SMS phone number

## 6. Message Routing

### 6.1 Message Classification

Messages are classified based on:
- Platform of origin
- Message type (text, voice, media, etc.)
- Recipient information
- Priority level

### 6.2 Routing Logic

The message router applies the following logic:
1. Parse incoming message metadata
2. Apply account type restrictions
3. Route to appropriate UI component
4. Apply privacy settings
5. Update message history

## 7. Feature Access Control

### 7.1 Account Type Restrictions

Each account type has specific cross-platform capabilities:
- Basic/Public: Read-only access to some platforms
- Legacy/OG: Full access to all configured platforms
- Pro/Ultra/Ultra Elite: Enhanced features and priority access
- Anon Pro/Anon: Privacy-focused platform access

### 7.2 Platform-Specific Features

Some features are only available on specific platforms:
- Voice chat (Discord, Telegram)
- Event scheduling (Discord, Telegram)
- Rich media sharing (All platforms)
- Payment integration (Twitter/X, SMS)

## 8. Security Implementation

### 8.1 End-to-End Encryption

All messages are encrypted before being sent to external platforms:
- AES-256-GCM for message content
- RSA-2048 for key exchange
- PBKDF2 for key derivation

### 8.2 Platform Authentication

Each platform adapter uses secure authentication:
- OAuth2 for Discord and Twitter/X
- Bot tokens for Telegram
- Signal CLI configuration for Signal
- Platform APIs for SMS

## 9. Data Synchronization

### 9.1 Local Storage

All message data is stored locally:
- Encrypted message history
- Platform-specific settings
- User preferences
- Trust ratings

### 9.2 Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise between platforms:
- Timestamp-based resolution
- User preference prioritization
- Manual conflict resolution option
- Audit trail maintenance

## 10. Performance Optimization

### 10.1 Message Queuing

Messages are queued for optimal delivery:
- Priority-based queuing
- Rate limiting per platform
- Retry mechanisms
- Delivery confirmation

### 10.2 Resource Management

Platform adapters manage resources efficiently:
- Connection pooling
- Memory optimization
- Background synchronization
- Idle connection handling

## 11. Error Handling

### 11.1 Platform-Specific Errors

Each adapter handles platform-specific errors:
- Authentication failures
- Rate limiting
- Service outages
- API changes

### 11.2 Unified Error Reporting

Errors are reported through a unified system:
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed technical logs
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Fallback options

## 12. Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Adapter Testing

Each platform adapter is tested individually:
- Authentication workflows
- Message sending/receiving
- Error handling
- Performance benchmarks

### 12.2 Integration Testing

Cross-platform functionality is tested:
- Message routing between platforms
- Identity consistency
- Feature availability
- Security measures

### 12.3 User Acceptance Testing

Real-world usage scenarios are tested:
- Multi-platform conversations
- Feature restrictions by account type
- Privacy mode functionality
- Performance under load
